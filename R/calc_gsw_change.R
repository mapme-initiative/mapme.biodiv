#' Calculate Global Surface Water (GSW) Change
#'
#' The change in water occurrence intensity between the two periods is derived
#' from homologous pairs of months (i.e. same months containing valid
#' observations in both periods). The difference in the occurrence of surface
#' water was calculated for each homologous pair of months. The average of all
#' of these differences constitutes the Surface Water Occurrence change
#' intensity. The raster files have integer cell values between [0, 200] where 0
#' represents surface water loss and 200 represents surface water gain.
#'
#' The pixel values are aggregated using method provided via the
#' \code{stats_gsw} parameter.
#'
#' @param x A single polygon for which to calculate the GSW statistics.
#' @param global_surface_water_change The GSW Change data source.
#' @param engine The preferred processing functions from either one of "zonal",
#' "extract" or "exactextract". Default: "extract".
#' @param stats_gsw Aggregation function with which the data are combined.
#' Default: "mean".
#' @return A tibble containing the aggregated GSW change indicator. The column
#' name is a concatenation of "global_surface_water_change_" + \code{stats_gsw}.
