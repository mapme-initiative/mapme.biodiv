#' Calculate Global Surface Water (GSW) Occurrence
#'
#' GSW occurrence raw data comes in raster files with integer cell values
#' between [0, 100]. This value gives the percentage of the time that a given
#' pixel was classified as water during the entire observation period. So a 0
#' denotes a pixel that was never classified as water, 100 denotes a pixel with
#' permanent water.
#'
#' The pixel values are aggregated using method provided via the
#' \code{stats_gsw} parameter.
#'
#' @param x A single polygon for which to calculate the GSW statistics.
#' @param global_surface_water_occurrence The GSW Occurrence data source.
#' @param engine The preferred processing functions from either one of "zonal",
#' "extract" or "exactextract". Default: "extract".
#' @param stats_gsw Aggregation function with which the data are combined.
#' Default: "mean".
#' @return A tibble containing the aggregated occurrence indicator. The column
#' name is a concatenation of "global_surface_water_occurrence_" +
#' \code{stats_gsw}.
#' @keywords internal
#' @include register.R
