#' Global Surface Water Change
#'
#' The Global Surface Water dataset was developed by the European Commission's
#' Joint Research Centre in the framework of the Copernicus Programme. It maps
#' the location and temporal distribution of water surfaces at the global scale
#' over the past 3.8 decades and provides statistics on their extent and change.
#'
#' The change in water occurrence intensity between the two periods is derived
#' from homologous pairs of months (i.e. same months containing valid
#' observations in both periods). The difference in the occurrence of surface
#' water was calculated for each homologous pair of months. The average of all
#' of these differences constitutes the Surface Water Occurrence change
#' intensity. The raster files have integer cell values between \code{[0, 200]}
#' where 0 represents surface water loss and 200 represents surface water gain.

#' Global Surface Water Transitions

#' The Global Surface Water dataset was developed by the European Commission's

#' the location and temporal distribution of water surfaces at the global scale
#' over the past 3.8 decades and provides statistics on their extent and change.
#'
#' GSW transition data contains information about the type of surface water
#' change for each pixel. The raster files have integer cell values between
#' \code{[0, 10]} that code for different transition classes:
#'
#' | Value | Transition Class      |
#' |-------|-----------------------|
#' | 1     | Permanent             |
#' | 2     | New Permanent         |

#'
#' GSW seasonality describes the intra-annual distribution of surface water for

#' Global Surface Water Recurrence
#'
#' The Global Surface Water dataset was developed by the European Commission's
#' Joint Research Centre in the framework of the Copernicus Programme. It maps
#' the location and temporal distribution of water surfaces at the global scale
#' over the past 3.8 decades and provides statistics on their extent and change.
#'
#' Water Recurrence is a measurement of the degree of variability in the
#' presence of water from year to year. It describes the frequency with which
#' water returned to a particular location from one year to another, and is
#' expressed as a percentage. The raster files have integer cell values between
#' \code{[0, 100]}, where 100 represents that water reoccurs predictably every
#' year, whereas lower values indicate that water only occurs episodically.

#' Global Surface Water Occurrence
#'
#' The Global Surface Water dataset was developed by the European Commission's
#' Joint Research Centre in the framework of the Copernicus Programme. It maps
#' the location and temporal distribution of water surfaces at the global scale
#' over the past 3.8 decades and provides statistics on their extent and change.
#'
#' GSW occurrence raw data comes in raster files with integer cell values
#' between \code{[0, 100]}. This value gives the percentage of the time that a
#' given pixel was classified as water during the entire observation period. So
#' a 0 denotes a pixel that was never classified as water, 100 denotes a pixel
#' with permanent water.
