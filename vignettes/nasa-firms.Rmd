## Overview

`{mapme.biodiversity}` can be used to simply download a number of
spatial resources and then conduct a custom analysis with that data.
This tutorial shows how to access the downloaded data and conducting
a small example analysis. For the scope of this tutorial, we are
interested in analyzing fire intensities in the Serengeti National Park
(NP), Tanzania. We are going to use `{mapme.biodiversity}` to download a
fire detection product based on the MODIS satellites distributed by NASA
and then conduct a fairly simple analysis of fire intensities within the
national park.

## Downloading data

First, we start by loading the required packages needed for the
analysis.

```{r load-pkgs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(rgl)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(units)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(spatstat)
library(lubridate)
library(mapme.biodiversity)
```

Next, we create a directory to write our data to. We keep the path to
this directory in a variable, because we are going to need it later to
access the data.

```{r data-dir, eval = FALSE}
data_dir <- "assets/data"
dir.create(data_dir, recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
```

We are using the `{wdpar}` package to
download the data base of protected areas in Tanzania and then subset it
to the Serengeti NP. Note, that we cast the geometry to `"POLYGON"`
because that type of geometry is actually expected by
`{mapme.biodiversity}`.

```{r data-aoi, eval = FALSE}
data <- wdpa_fetch("Tanzania", download_dir = data_dir)
aoi <- data[data$NAME == "Serengeti National Park", ]
aoi <- st_cast(aoi[1, ], "POLYGON")
```

In the next code chunk, we initiate a portfolio with the geometry of the
Serengeti NP specifying the temporal extent we are interested in - here
the years 2010 to 2020 - as well as the output directory where the data
will be downloaded to.

```{r data-portfolio, eval = FALSE}
aoi <- init_portfolio(aoi, years = 2010:2020, outdir = data_dir)
```

We are now ready to actually download the data. Note, that running the
next code chunk actually takes significant time because the `nasa_firms`
resource is a rather large data set.

```{r data-download, eval = FALSE}
aoi <- get_resources(aoi, "nasa_firms", instrument = "MODIS")
```

The `nasa_firms` data set as processed by the `{mapme.biodiversity}`
package is collection of points stored in a GeoPackage for each year of
observation indicating the detection of a fire with an associated
confidence level of the detection. Follow the resources linked in
`help(nasa_firms)` to find out more about the data.

After the download has completed, we can find the data in the `data_dir`
we specified earlier when constructing the portfolio. There will be a
new subfolder for each requested resource with the same name.

```{r data-read, eval = FALSE}
gpkgs <- list.files(file.path(data_dir, "nasa_firms"),
  pattern = ".gpkg", full.names = TRUE
)
nasa_firms <- map_dfr(gpkgs, function(x) {
  read_sf(x, wkt_filter = st_as_text(st_as_sfc(st_bbox(aoi))))
})
nasa_firms <- nasa_firms[unlist(st_contains(aoi, nasa_firms)), ]
```

```{r write-data, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
st_write(select(aoi, WDPAID, NAME),
  "assets/data/serengeti.gpkg",
  delete_dsn = TRUE
)
nasa_firms %>%
  filter(confidence > 50) %>%
  select(acq_date, confidence) %>%
  st_write("assets/data/nasa_firms.gpkg", delete_dsn = TRUE)
```

Since the `nasa_firms` data is a global data set but we are only
interested in the fires observed in the Serengeti NP, we apply one
filter when reading in the data to contain only points within the
bounding box of our AOI. Then we apply another filter to subset to
points that actually fall within the polygon.

That's it! We actually accessed the original data that the
`{mapme.biodiversity}` package downloaded for us. Now we can work with
that data in a way that is suitable for our analysis. Follow along if
you want to learn how the `nasa_firms` resource can be used to map fire
intensity within the Serengeti NP!

## EDA of fire events

```{r read-data, echo=FALSE}
nasa_firms <- read_sf("assets/data/nasa_firms.gpkg")
aoi <- read_sf("assets/data/serengeti.gpkg")
```

First, let's take a look at what we have. We select a confidence value
of 50 to include only those detection with a higher probability of
actually representing a fire event. Then, we construct a new variable
representing the year of the observation and finally create a plot
showing the spatio-temporal distribution of fire events in the Serengeti
NP.

```{r map-data, warning=FALSE}
nasa_firms <- filter(nasa_firms, confidence > 50)
nasa_firms$year <- as.factor(year(nasa_firms$acq_date))

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aoi, inherit.aes = TRUE) +
  geom_sf(data = nasa_firms, alpha = .1, color = "#f18e26") +
  coord_sf(expand = FALSE) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 34.0, to = 35.0, by = .5)) +
  facet_wrap(~year, nrow = 2, switch = "x")
```

Visually, it seems there is a gradient with higher numbers of fires
detected in the North-East of the National Park towards lower numbers in
the South-West of the park. Also, during some years substantially fewer
fires seem to occur compared to other years.

Let's confirm that last observation by plotting a barplot of the numbers
of fires for every years. We find the most fires occurred during 2016
and 2020 while the lowest numbers were observed in 2017 and 2011. The
difference between the highest and lowest observed fires is
`r round(range(table(nasa_firms$year))[2]-range(table(nasa_firms$year))[1])`
fires while the average number of fires per year is
`r round(mean(table(nasa_firms$year)))`

```{r fires-year}
nasa_firms %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(as.factor(year)), fill = "#f18e26") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Count of fire events")
```

We now take a closer look at the intra-annual distribution of fires. For
that, again, we construct a new variable indicating the month a certain
observation was made.

```{r fires-month}
nasa_firms$month <- factor(format(as.Date(nasa_firms$acq_date), "%b"),
  labels = month(1:12, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)
)

nasa_firms %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = month), fill = "#f18e26") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Count of fire events")
```

We see that there is a very clear seasonal pattern in the occurrences of
fires with most fires observed in the months of June and July. During
February and September there are also substantiall numbers of fires
observer, but fewer than during the fire season. We now might look at
the intra-annual distribution from a different angle by dividing a year
into quarters starting with the month of March using the meteorological
division of a year.

```{r fires-quarter}
nasa_firms$quarter <- quarter(nasa_firms$acq_date, fiscal_start = 3)

nasa_firms %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  mutate(quarter = paste0("Q", quarter)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = quarter), fill = "#f18e26") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Quarter", y = "Count of fire events")
```

From this perspective, the most relevant quarter for analyzing fires in
the Serengeti NP seems to be the second one spanning the months June,
July, and August. We thus filter the data to only include fire
observations from the second quarter and ignore the rest for the scope
of this tutorial. Again, let's have a spatial visualization of the data
we are going to work with now.

```{r filter-data}
nasa_firms <- filter(nasa_firms, quarter == 2)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aoi) +
  geom_sf(data = nasa_firms, alpha = .1, color = "#f18e26") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 34.0, to = 35.0, by = .5)) +
  facet_wrap(~year, nrow = 2, switch = "x")
```

## Kernel-based intensity estimation

From the visual interpretation of the data we might conclude that the
occurrence of fire events is spatially clustered with a tendency of more
fires observed in the North-East compared to the South-West. Imagine we
wanted to highlight areas where park rangers could watch emerging fires
more closely in order to prevent them from burning too large an area.
One approach to produce such an map is to use a kernel-based estimation
of the intensity of an observed point pattern. The
[`spatstat`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=spatstat) package
provides a ton of functionality to work with point patterns, one of
which allows an empirical estimation of the intensity surface. For that,
we need to transform our data into a planar coordinate system and plug
it into a `spatstat` specific point-pattern object.

```{r kernel-density, warning=FALSE}
center <- st_coordinates(st_centroid(aoi))
laea <- paste0(
  "+proj=laea +lat_0=", center[2],
  " +lon_0=", center[1], " +x_0=0 +y_0=0"
)

aoi_laea <- st_transform(aoi, crs = laea)
fires_laea <- st_transform(nasa_firms, crs = laea)

ppp_fires <- as.ppp(c(st_as_sfc(aoi_laea), st_as_sfc(fires_laea)))
summary(ppp_fires)
```

The summary of the Planar Point Pattern object shows some important
information. First, there are `r nrow(nasa_firms)` points to begin with.
These are distributed in an observation window which is constituted by
the shape of the Serengeti NP and has a size of `r round(st_area(aoi))`
m². Thus, we obtain an average intensity for the whole national park of
`r nrow(nasa_firms) / st_area(aoi)` 1/m² or
`r round(set_units(nrow(nasa_firms) / st_area(aoi), "1/km2"), 4)` 1/km².

Let's now test our assumption that the point pattern of fires observed
shows a tendency to clustering. For this we use `spatstat` to estimate
Ripley's K function (see
[here](http://book.spatstat.org/sample-chapters/chapter07.pdf) for more
information). The K function compares an observed point pattern to a
simulation of a number of patterns that are the product of a process
showing complete spatially randomness (CSR). The statistic is a count of
the number of neighboring points within an increasing distance *r* from
each point in both the observed pattern an the simulated ones. Comparing
the two, simply put, allows to draw conclusions about the behavior of
the observed pattern at certain distances. If the observed number of
points at a specific distance is higher than the expected one under CSR,
the points tend to cluster together at that distance. On the other hand,
if there are less points in the spatial neighborhood of a point than
expected under CSR, there is an indication of inhibition between points.

Note, that the estimation of K assumes that the point process is
stationary - that is the intensity of fire events is homogeneous within
the observation window. If intensity is in- homogeneous, we cannot be
sure if the clustering is a result of the spatially varying intensity
(first order effect) or because points attract each other to form
clusters (second order effect). Since we are not interested in drawing
conclusions about the process generating the observed pattern in this
tutorial, we can accept this caveat.

```{r fire-density}
k_env <- envelope(ppp_fires, Kest,
  nsim = 99, correction = "border", verbose = FALSE
)
plot(k_env)
```

We see that for the largest part of varying the distance *r*, the
observed pattern seems to be more clustered than a CSR process (note,
the units of *r* are meters). For very large values of *r* the observed
pattern is within the expected range of CSR.

We now are interested in producing a map of estimated intensity which
informs us about the areas where fires are more likely to occur. For
this we are using a kernel-based empirical estimation of the observed
intensity. That means we are moving a kernel over the point pattern and
calculate the empirical intensity within the current kernel. The main
challenge here is to determine a bandwidth parameter *sigma* that best
fits the data. The standard approach in `spatstat` is to solely
determine *sigma* based on the size and the shape of the observation
window. We might achieve a better visualization with a customized value
for *sigma*. Since the point pattern shows a tendency towards
clustering, we apply a simple heuristic to derive a value for *sigma*.
We calculate the difference between the observed K and the K values
under CSR. Then, we determine at which spatial distance *r* the
difference between the two is maximal. To get *sigma* we than simply
take half the value of that distance.

```{r get-sigmas}
diff <- k_env$obs - k_env$theo
sigma <- k_env$r[which.max(diff)] / 2
```

This indicates that the distance between the observed and simulated K is
maximal at a distance of `r formatC(sigma*2, format = "d")` so that our bandwidth for
the kernel estimation of the intensity is `r round(sigma)`. We can now use the
`density()` function to apply a kernel-based estimation of intensity
with our custom sigma value.

```{r densities-sigma}
dens_emp <- density(ppp_fires, sigma = sigma)
plot(dens_emp, ribbon = FALSE, addcontour = TRUE)
```

Let's make a quick sanity check if the empirical intensity matches the
point pattern. For that, remember that the units for the intensity is
fires per m². We thus need to multiply the sum of the pixel values by
their spatial resolution.

```{r density-sum}
res <- dens_emp$xstep * dens_emp$ystep
sum(dens_emp) * res
nrow(nasa_firms)
```

While not being actual identical values, the kernel-based estimate of
the number of events is close enough to the observed one. We now might
also include a 3D animation of the intensity surface to allow an even
better investigation.

```{r plot-fun}
map2color <- function(x, pal, limits = range(x, na.rm = TRUE)) {
  pal[findInterval(x, seq(limits[1], limits[2], length.out = length(pal) + 1),
    all.inside = TRUE
  )]
}

pal <- colorRampPalette(c("blue", "yellow", "red"))
cols <- map2color(dens_emp$v,
  pal = pal(100),
  limits = c(
    min(dens_emp$v, na.rm = TRUE),
    quantile(dens_emp$v, .75, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
)

persp3d(dens_emp$v,
  col = cols, xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", zlab = "Fire Intensity",
  main = "Fire intensity for Q2", aspect = c(1, 1, .65)
)
control <- par3dinterpControl(spin3d(axis = c(0, 0, 1)), 0, 12, steps = 40)
rglwidget() %>% playwidget(control, step = 0.01, loop = TRUE, rate = 0.5)
```
