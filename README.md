## About

Biodiversity areas, especially primary forests, provide multiple
ecosystem services for the local population and the planet as a whole.
The rapid expansion of human land use into natural ecosystems and the
impacts of the global climate crisis put natural ecosystems and the
global biodiversity under threat.

The mapme.biodiversity package helps to analyse a number of biodiversity
related indicators and biodiversity threats based on freely available
geodata-sources such as the Global Forest Watch. It supports
computational efficient routines and heavy parallel computing in
cloud-infrastructures such as AWS or Microsoft Azure using in the
statistical programming language R. The package allows for the analysis
of global biodiversity portfolios with a thousand or millions of AOIs
which is normally only possible on dedicated platforms such as the
Google Earth Engine. It provides the possibility to e.g. analyse the
World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) for a number of relevant
indicators. The primary use case of this package is to support
scientific analysis and data science for individuals and organizations
who seek to preserve the planet biodiversity. Its development is funded
by the German Development Bank KfW.

## Installation

The package and its dependencies can be installed from CRAN via:

``` r
install.packages("mapme.biodiversity", dependencies = TRUE)
```

To install the development version, use the following command:

``` r
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/mapme-initiative/mapme.biodiversity", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Usage example

`{mapme.biodiversity}` works by constructing a portfolio from an sf
object. Specific raster and vector resource matching the spatio-temporal
extent of the portfolio are made available locally. Once all required
resources are available, indicators can be calculated individually for
each asset in the portfolio.

``` r
library(mapme.biodiversity)
library(sf)
```

    ## Linking to GEOS 3.12.1, GDAL 3.9.0, PROJ 9.4.0; sf_use_s2() is TRUE

Once you have decided on an indicator you are interested in, you can
start by making the required resource available for your portfolio.
Using `mapme_options()` you can set an output directory, control the
maximum size of polygons before they are chunked into smaller parts, and
control the verbosity of the package.

A portfolio is represented by an sf-object. It is required for the
object to only contain geometries of type `POLYGON` and `MULTIPOLYGON`
as assets. We can request the download of a resource for the spatial
extent of our portfolio by using the `get_resources()` function. We
simply supply our portfolio and one or more resource functions. Once the
resources were made available, we can query the calculation of an
indicator by using the `calc_indicators()` function. This function also
expects the portfolio as input and one or more indicator functions. Once
the indicator has been calculated for all assets in a portfolio, the
data is returned as a nested list column to the original portfolio
object. The output of each indicator is standardized to common format,
consisting of a tibble with columns `datetime`, `variable`, `unit`, and
`value`. We can transform the the data to long format by using
`portfolio_long()`.

``` r
mapme_options(
  outdir = system.file("res", package = "mapme.biodiversity"),
  chunk_size = 1e6, # in ha
  verbose = FALSE
)

aoi <- system.file("extdata", "sierra_de_neiba_478140_2.gpkg", package = "mapme.biodiversity") %>%
  sf::read_sf() %>%
  get_resources(
    get_gfw_treecover(version = "GFC-2023-v1.11"),
    get_gfw_lossyear(version = "GFC-2023-v1.11"),
    get_gfw_emissions()
  ) %>%
  calc_indicators(calc_treecover_area_and_emissions(years = 2016:2017, min_size = 1, min_cover = 30)) %>%
  portfolio_long()

aoi
```

## Using cloud storages

`{mapme.biodiversity}` leverages GDAL’s capabilities for data I/O. For
users of this package, that means that integrating a cloud storage is as
easy as setting up a configuration file and changing the `outdir`
argument in `mapme_options()`. While you could also decide to use
environment variables, we recommend to set up a GDAL config file. You
can find GDAL’s documentation on this topic
[here](https://gdal.org/user/configoptions.html#gdal-configuration-file).

Suppose that we want to use an AWS S3 bucket that we control to write
resource data to. Let’s assume this bucket is already set up and we wish
to refer to it in our R code as `mapme-data`. The GDAL configuration
file should look something like this:

``` ini
[credentials]

[.mapme-data]
path=/vsis3/mapme-data
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-id>
```

The connection will be handled based on GDAL’s virtual file system. You
can find documentation on specific options for your cloud provider
[here](https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html#network-based-file-systems).

Ideally, you would also set the following in the `.Renviron` file in
your user’s home directory to ensure that GDAL is aware of this
configuration when an R session is started:

``` ini
GDAL_CONFIG_FILE = "<path-to-your-config-file>"
```

Then, in your scripts set the `outdir` option to the value specified
with the `path` variable in the configuration file:

``` r
mapme_options(outdir = "/vsis3/mapme-data")
```

## A note on parallel computing

`{mapme.biodiversity}` follows the parallel computing paradigm of the
[`{future}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future) package. That
means that you as a user are in the control if and how you would like to
set up parallel processing. Since `{mapme.biodiversity} v0.9`, we apply
pre-chunking to all assets in the portfolio. That means that assets are
split up into components of roughly the size of `chunk_size`. These
components can than be iterated over in parallel to speed up processing.
Indicator values will be aggregated automatically.

``` r
library(future)
plan(cluster, workers = 6)
```

As another example, with the code below one would apply parallel
processing of 2 assets, with each having 4 workers available to process
chunks, thus requiring a total of 8 available cores on the host machine.
Be sure to not request more workers than available on your machine.

``` r
library(progressr)

plan(cluster, workers = 2)

with_progress({
  aoi <- calc_indicators(
    aoi,
    calc_treecover_area_and_emissions(
      min_size = 1,
      min_cover = 30
    )
  )
})

plan(sequential) # close child processes
```

documentation](https://mapme-initiative.github.io/mapme.biodiversity/index.html)
