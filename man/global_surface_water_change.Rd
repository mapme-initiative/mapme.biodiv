\title{Global Surface Water Change}
\format{
A global tiled raster resource available for all land areas. The
reported data represent aggregated observations between 1984 -- 2021.

\description{
The Global Surface Water dataset was developed by the European Commission's
Joint Research Centre in the framework of the Copernicus Programme. It maps
the location and temporal distribution of water surfaces at the global scale
over the past 3.8 decades and provides statistics on their extent and change.
}
\details{
The change in water occurrence intensity between the two periods is derived
from homologous pairs of months (i.e. same months containing valid
observations in both periods). The difference in the occurrence of surface
water was calculated for each homologous pair of months. The average of all
of these differences constitutes the Surface Water Occurrence change
intensity. The raster files have integer cell values between \code{[0, 200]}
where 0 represents surface water loss and 200 represents surface water gain.
