\description{
The Terra and Aqua combined MCD64A1 Version 6.1 Burned Area data product is
a monthly, global gridded 500 meter (m) product containing per-pixel
burned-area and quality information. The MCD64A1 burned-area mapping approach
employs 500 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Surface
Reflectance imagery coupled with 1 kilometer (km) MODIS active fire observations.
}
\details{
The algorithm uses a burn sensitive Vegetation Index (VI) to create dynamic
thresholds that are applied to the composite data. The VI is derived from
MODIS shortwave infrared atmospherically corrected surface reflectance bands
5 and 7 with a measure of temporal texture. The algorithm identifies the date
of burn for the 500 m grid cells within each individual MODIS tile. The date
is encoded in a single data layer as the ordinal day of the calendar year on
which the burn occurred with values assigned to unburned land pixels and
additional special values reserved for missing data and water grid cells.
