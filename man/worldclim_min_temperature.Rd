\description{
This resource is published by Fick et al. (2017) "WorldClim 2: new 1-km
spatial resolution climate surfaces for global land areas" and
represents multiple climatic variables from which we will be requiring minimum
temperature, maximum temperature, and mean precipitation layers. The layers are
available to download for the period 1960 - 2021 on monthly basis from WorldClim.
}
\details{
This resource represents the minimum temperature, layers available to
download for the period 1960 - 2021 on monthly basis from WorldClim. Encoded
as (Â°C), representing the minimum temperature per output grid cell.
