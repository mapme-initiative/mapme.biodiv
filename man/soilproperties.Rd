\title{Calculate Zonal Soil Properties}
\usage{
calc_soilproperties(engine = "extract", stats = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{engine}{The preferred processing functions from either one of "zonal",
"extract" or "exactextract" as character.}

\item{stats}{Function to be applied to compute statistics for polygons either
single or multiple inputs as character. Supported statistics are: "mean",
"median", "sd", "min", "max", "sum" "var".}
}
\value{
A tibble with a column for the SoilGrid layer, the depth and the model
output statistic as well as additional columns for all zonal statistics
specified via \code{stats_soil}
}
\description{
This indicator allows the extraction of zonal statistics for resource layers
previously downloaded from SoilGrids, thus in total supporting the calculation
of zonal statistics for 10 different soil properties at 6 different depths for
a total of 4 different model outputs (stat). Zonal statistics will be calculated
for all SoilGrid layers that have been previously made available vie \code{get_resources()}.
