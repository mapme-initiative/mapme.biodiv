From ACLED's homepage: \emph{The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project
(ACLED) is a disaggregated data collection, analysis, and crisis mapping

fatalities, and types of all reported political violence and protest events
around the world. The ACLED team conducts analysis to describe, explore, and
test conflict scenarios, and makes both data and analysis open for free use
by the public.}
