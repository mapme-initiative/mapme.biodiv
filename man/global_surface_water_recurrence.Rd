\title{Global Surface Water Recurrence}
\format{
A global tiled raster resource available for all land areas. The
reported data represent aggregated observations between 1984 -- 2021.

\description{
The Global Surface Water dataset was developed by the European Commission's
Joint Research Centre in the framework of the Copernicus Programme. It maps
the location and temporal distribution of water surfaces at the global scale
over the past 3.8 decades and provides statistics on their extent and change.

\details{
Water Recurrence is a measurement of the degree of variability in the
presence of water from year to year. It describes the frequency with which
water returned to a particular location from one year to another, and is
expressed as a percentage. The raster files have integer cell values between
\code{[0, 100]}, where 100 represents that water reoccurs predictably every
year, whereas lower values indicate that water only occurs episodically.
