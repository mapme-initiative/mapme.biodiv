\description{
This resource is produced by a neirest-neighbour matching of a crowd-sourced
campaign to map dominant driver of forest loss based on visual interpretation
of VHR images matched with Global Forest Loss data by Hansen (2013) version 1.7
The forest loss layer was resampled to a resolution of 100 or 1.000 meters.
Dominant drivers were determined for the period 2008 to 2009.
